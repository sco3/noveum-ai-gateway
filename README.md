## Quick Start

### Installation

You can install MagicAPI Gateway using one of these methods:

#### Using Cargo Install

```bash
cargo install magicapi-ai-gateway
```

After installation, you can start the gateway by running:
```bash
magicapi-ai-gateway
```

#### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/magicapi/ai-gateway
cd ai-gateway
```

2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

3. Run the server:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

The server will start on `http://127.0.0.1:3000` by default.

### Running the Gateway

You can configure the gateway using environment variables:

```bash
# Basic configuration
export RUST_LOG=info

# Start the gateway
magicapi-ai-gateway

# Or with custom port
PORT=8080 magicapi-ai-gateway
```

## Usage

### Making Requests

To make requests through the gateway, use the `/v1/*` endpoint and specify the provider using the `x-provider` header.

#### Example: OpenAI Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-provider: openai" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-openai-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

#### Example: GROQ Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-provider: groq" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-groq-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "llama2-70b-4096",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "stream": true,
    "max_tokens": 300
  }'
```

#### Example: Anthropic Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-provider: anthropic" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-anthropic-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a poem"}],
    "stream": true,
    "max_tokens": 1024
  }'
```

#### Example: Fireworks Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-provider: fireworks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-fireworks-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-8b-instruct",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a poem"}],
    "stream": true,
    "max_tokens": 300,
    "temperature": 0.6,
    "top_p": 1,
    "top_k": 40
  }'
```

#### Example: Together AI Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-provider: together" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-together-api-key" \
  -d '{
    "model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a poem"}],
    "stream": true,
    "max_tokens": 512,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 0.7,
    "top_k": 50,
    "repetition_penalty": 1
  }'
```

Note: When using Anthropic as the provider, the gateway automatically:
- Routes requests to Anthropic's message API
- Converts the Authorization Bearer token to the required x-api-key format
- Adds the required anthropic-version header

## Configuration

The gateway can be configured using environment variables:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug # Logging level (debug, info, warn, error)
```

## Performance

MagicAPI Developer AI Gateway is designed for maximum performance:

- **Zero-cost abstractions** using Rust's ownership model
- **Asynchronous I/O** with Tokio for optimal resource utilization
- **Connection pooling** via Reqwest for efficient HTTP connections
- **Memory-efficient** request/response proxying
- **Minimal overhead** in the request path
- **Optimized streaming** response handling

## Architecture

The gateway leverages the best-in-class Rust ecosystem:

- **Axum** - High-performance web framework
- **Tokio** - Industry-standard async runtime
- **Tower-HTTP** - Robust HTTP middleware
- **Reqwest** - Fast and reliable HTTP client
- **Tracing** - Zero-overhead logging and diagnostics

## Security Notes

- Always run behind a reverse proxy in production
- Configure CORS appropriately for your use case
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Consider adding rate limiting for production use

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install development dependencies
cargo install cargo-watch

# Run tests
cargo test

# Run with hot reload
cargo watch -x run
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Refused**
   - Check if port 3000 is available
   - Verify the HOST and PORT settings

2. **Streaming Not Working**
   - Ensure `Accept: text/event-stream` header is set
   - Check client supports streaming
   - Verify provider supports streaming for the requested endpoint

3. **Provider Errors**
   - Verify provider API keys are correct
   - Check provider-specific headers are properly set
   - Ensure the provider endpoint exists and is correctly formatted
